- `CallAnalyticsResponse` - Comprehensive call analytics data

## Integration Flow

### ðŸ“ž Call Processing Workflow
1. **Call Detected** â†’ `CallReceiver` detects incoming/outgoing calls
2. **Call Started** â†’ `EnhancedCallService` fetches call history for agent context
3. **Call Ended** â†’ Service automatically logs call with ticket creation enabled
4. **Ticket Created** â†’ If backend creates ticket, popup appears for agent review
5. **Agent Action** â†’ Agent can quickly update ticket details or view full ticket

### ðŸ”„ Real-Time Updates
- Call logging happens automatically in background
- Ticket popups appear immediately after call completion
- No manual intervention required for basic ticket creation
- Agents can add notes and update priority/status in popup

## Usage Instructions

### For Agents
1. **During Calls**: System automatically displays call history if available
2. **After Calls**: Ticket popup appears if ticket was auto-created
3. **Quick Updates**: Add notes, change priority/status in popup
4. **Full Management**: Click "View Full" to open complete ticket details

### For Administrators  
1. **Monitoring**: All calls are automatically logged with proper metadata
2. **Analytics**: Call statistics available through analytics endpoints
3. **Configuration**: Ticket creation rules managed on backend
4. **Compliance**: Complete call audit trail maintained

## Technical Details

### ðŸ”’ Security & Permissions
- All API calls use Bearer token authentication
- Required Android permissions already configured
- Sensitive data encrypted in transit
- User role-based access controls maintained

### âš¡ Performance Optimizations
- Asynchronous call processing prevents UI blocking
- Background services handle heavy operations
- Efficient broadcast system for real-time updates
- Minimal memory footprint for popup activities

### ðŸŽ¯ Error Handling
- Network error resilience with retry logic
- Graceful degradation if backend unavailable  
- User-friendly error messages
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Next Steps

### Phase 4 Recommendations

2. **Call Recording Integration** - Add support for call recording playback
3. **AI-Powered Insights** - Implement call sentiment analysis
4. **Custom Workflows** - Allow customization of automatic ticket creation rules

### Testing & Deployment
1. **Unit Testing** - Test individual components with mock data
2. **Integration Testing** - Verify end-to-end call processing flow
3. **User Acceptance Testing** - Validate agent workflows
4. **Production Deployment** - Gradual rollout with monitoring
